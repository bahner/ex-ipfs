  IPFS (the InterPlanetary File Syste
  new hypermedia distribution protocol, addressed by 
  content and identities. IPFS enables the creation of 
  completely distributed applications. It aims to make the web 
  faster, safer, and more open.


  IPFS is a distributed file system that seeks to connect 
  all computing devices with the same system of files. In some 
  ways, this is similar to the original aims of the Web, but IPFS 
  is actually more similar to a single bittorrent swarm exchanging 
  git objects.
