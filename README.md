# Ipfs Api wrapper library for Elixir

![](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmQJ68PFMDdAsgCZvA1UVzzn18asVcf7HVvCDgpjiSCAse)


## This library is still a work in progress

Thus far 65% of the functionality has been implmented in this particular API.  Most of the funcitons do not support adding in the optional arguments just yet.  Once I've implmented all of the commands I will work on adding the optional flags into each function. 

# Install

Add Ipfs_elixir to your `mix.exs` dependencies:
```elixir
def deps do
[
    {:ipfs_elixir, "~> 0.0.4"},
]
end
```

and run `$ mix deps.get` to install the dependency.  

## Usage
